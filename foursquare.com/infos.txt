--Check out kid-friendly exhibits (like King Tut NYC) right in Times Square. Reserve tickets to avoid long lines, and eat before you enter – no food or drink is allowed. Powered by ParentsConnect.com
--A city that was buried in ash for over 1,500 years. Get a fascinating glimpse into the ancient city.  
--I thought this was a great exhibit.
--The King Tut Exhibit was fascinating! So beautifully presented and well done. Looking forward to more exhibits at Discovery TSX!
--Just went to the King Tut Exhibit with my family and it was amazing!! I&#39;m not sure how the people below can even compare this exhibit to the Met, this is the only one with artifacts from his tomb!
--Awesome set
--Pompeii the exhibit: Life and death in the shadow of Vesuvius is great.
--I&#39;m working as the Head Artifact Handler here for the Harry Potter Exhibition and it is an amazing experience! Come check it out. :)
--Had such a great time at the exhibit with my friends &amp; fam. Traveled all the way from Boston to go and it was well worth it!
--It&#39;s an amazing exhibition, no words, perfect.
--Mind blowing exhibit &quot;Body World&#39;s&quot; is phenomenon.
--Check out the Dead Sea Scrolls exhibit before April 15, 2012! An incredible journey through the history of the traditions and events that continue to impact Israel and the rest of the world today.
--You ever have one of those days where you&#39;re forced to deal with a giant spider, a centaur, and a phoenix? Today is one of those days.
--Harry Potter Exhibition is a must-see for even a casual Harry Potter fan. Get up close to the horcruxes and deathly hallows. Get sorted by the Sorting Hat. Excellent exhibit.
--Such great exhibits!
--Got tickets to Harry Potter exhibit for my friend&#39;s birthday and she loved it!
--Harry Potter is cool for major fanatics, but it&#39;s also very touristy! Pompeii keeps the tourists (albeit less than Potter), but offers a more fulfilling experience.
--Getting the audio is well worth it - adds a lot
--Saw the Nathan Sawaya &#39;Lego&#39; exhibit...amazing what he can do with Lego!
--The brick art was just unbelievable.
--Its worth spending the $7 on the audio tour but buy stuff online, not the gift shop. The markup is mind blowing. $180 for a book that&#39;s $45 online. No photos rule ruins some fun, but a good exhibit.
--Amazing exhibition of the Dead Sea Scrolls!
--Pompeii exhibit is a MUST. Very well done and moving.
--Harry Potter was short, but cool if you are a fan.  Muggles would probably be bored.  Crowded though.  Don&#39;t feel you have walk in line among the other lemmings.  Pompeii was great! Combo tix save $.
--Pompeii was definitely worth the money for those who will never see the real city. Harry Potter was overly crowded and shorter than expected, but was ok. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d do the HP exhibit again.
--The King Tut exhibit is well worth the visit. The exhibit provides a myriad of treasures of the late King, from big ones to small ones. I was shocked at the amount of time I actually spent in there.
--this exhibit is here for a limited time and it was maze of mystery and awesome artifacts from b.c. Times and the music and layout made u feel like u were in those times...it took 1 1/2 to get through
--A great exhibit...you can&#39;t take photos and no backpacks, strollers and shopping bags are allowed. Here in NYC through the middle of January
--A must see one in a lifetime  spectacular exhibit otherwise only seen in Egypt
--Check out the 3D movie
--The most outrageously disappointing experience of my life. The 20 minute pointlessly 3D movie doesn&#39;t even mention him in any detail. Do not go in with high expectations...
--King Tut exhibit is a waste of time. They don&#39;t have anything significantly amazing. And the &quot;mummy&quot; at the end is a disapponting replica. Go to the met instead.
--This sucks, especially if you&#39;ve been to the Met.
--King Tut exhibit was interesting but a shadow of the exhibit that was at the Met many years ago. All the elaborate gold items you&#39;d expect to see are still in Egypt. Money is better spent elsewhere.
--Titanic: the artifact exhibition  
--Step back in time and relive the Klondike gold rush!
--Body pulse is really good
--Never pay retail. There is usually a discount or Groupon available.
--Saw the Body Worlds exhibit...really good!
--The Art of the Brick exhibit is so amazing to see, but very short. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth $22.
--The art of the Bricks! Very cool
--The art of the brick is a must see.
--Lego exhibit so awesome. A bit short but so worth it for the kid in you. Look at them from different angles and distances
--This place sucks dont come here if you have children or babies in strollers. They make you leave the stroller and carry baby around for an hour.put my baby on the floor so I can go to the bathroom
--Their exhibits beat  other nyc museums anyway plus they sometimes have specials on tickets
--Events are poorly run! get there very early if you want to participate in any autograph sessions.
--The Harry Potter exhibit is amazing...no photos allowed sadly :(
--Pay with Amex and get a complimentary audio guide
--Harry Potter exhibit was okay but certainly not worth $30 bucks a ticket.
--Mitnehmen, wenn man den NY Pass hat. Ansonsten zu teuer.

--More of a kids playground than a museum
--Very cool exhibits and decent explanations from the museum staff. However, go early on a school day to avoid longer lines of screaming kids.
--This place is a total gem! All the exhibits turn into rides or activities!!
--Fun museum! Ask questions and enjoy the experiences! Math is fun!
--A tourist trap full of broken Microsoft gimmicks.
--Most things here are broken.
--Opening December 15, 2012!
--Get there late? Sit and access the WiFi.
--Just a kids playground, but expensive.
--It was a slightly disappointing experience. Many installations weren&#39;t working and several were not operating bc museum admin was short. For the price, it needs some work. Great idea, poor execution.
--Expensive and nothing/ no one to explain the actual math.  Very crowded.
--Mia had a great time. We are now members.
--Take a ride on the square wheeled tricycle and test your abilities at the enigma cafe.
--Not worth the price, especially for adults. Many of the interactive exhibits are out of order or missing pieces, etc.
--The downstairs is the best part and don&#39;t forget to bring your patience. Some of the puzzles are hard!!
--I don&#39;t agree with the negative comments.  My 3 kids were very engaged by the exhibits and ended up asking me a lot of questions about math.  Definitely stimulated their minds.
--They will not honor reciprocity with other SDTC museums. Very disappointing.
--This is by far the most underwhelming museum in NYC.  If you are looking for an expensive indoor playground, try the Children&#39;s Museum of Manhattan.  A lot more exhibits and a much friendlier staff.
--Amazing!!! great for all ages
--Free admission for Bloomberg employees and up to 3 guests.
--Enjoyed idea of interactive experience, definitely visually and mind stimulating process. Not everything that is on displayed is available over the counter. Staff is pleasant and positive.

--Half the exhibits were broken but still $16 entry fee. Sucks. Wait a few months!
--Noble idea, mediocre execution. Space is too small. Too many exhibits not working yet. Disorganized, w/no eduqcational narrative. Poorly written kiosks. It just opened, so I&#39;d hope it gets better.
--Pretty lame. Lots of screaming children. Very few actually interesting mathematical exhibits/installations.

--Perfect for visitors and locals alike.  Learn about the rich history of NYC through photos, film, and actual living spaces.
--September 11, 2001, wasn&#39;t the first time an airplane flew into a New York city skyscraper. This museum is home to an artifact that tells of a largely forgotten incident.  
--Check out the &quot;On the Move: Transportation Toys from the Permanent Collection&quot; exhibition. The transportation toys on view are modeled on vehicles once commonly recognized throughout our city.  
--Designed by Joseph H. Freedlander, the museum’s 1932 Georgian Revival building features a distinguished red brick façade, a marble portico replicating Federal Hall, and a handsome front terrace.
--Check out the Museum&#39;s 23 minute film &quot;Timescapes&quot; - in a unique three screen multimedia format. Focus on the far right screen, otherwise you&#39;ll be lost. The content of the film is great.

--See the Timescapes show. Its about a half hour long and well worth it.
--Among the miscellany kept in storage is a pair of fake eyelashes worn by Joan Crawford. The falsies were originally part of a group of more than 80 pairs, which were sold at auction after her death.  
--Feels so clean and modern and in such an old building. Great exhibits that are easy to digest. Check out the micro spaces exhibit when it&#39;s still just an exhibit - hopefully it&#39;ll be reality someday!
--Cultured and telling. Pieces here have great range and depth. Gets a bit pretentious at times. Many 5th avenue types assume it as their own. Avoid admission by saying that you live in East Harlem.

--Fashion exhibit is pretty dope.
--This was used as the location for the school in Gossip Girl
--Activism exhibit is fantastic and actually includes a ton about the Bronx! Woo hoo

--It&#39;s not widely advertised, but the museum admission is one of many with &quot;suggested donation&quot; pricing.

--Can be a hassle to go there, but once you&#39;re inside check the upstairs exhibits.
--Coming to MCNY with a group? Groups of 10+ visitors can participate in guided or self-guided tours of special exhibitions.
--Definitely check out the stained glass window in the NY Interiors room. Looks like you are looking through palace windows onto an ocean&#39;s back bay.
--Make sure you watch the history of NYC video. Worth 25 min of your time.
--Easy to get to off the 6 (20 min from Grand Central) and entirely worth the trip. Beautiful building and timely special exhibits like Hurricane Sandy photography and City as Canvas. Shop is cool too.

--Founded in 1977. New art, new ideas...amazing. Parties here are a must. Great place to see live music as well.
--Designed by the Japanese architects SANAA: “The visual signals this building sends—it is at once crisp and pliable, solid and permeable—seem deliberately ambiguous.”  
--If you are ever invited to a party there, especially in the Sky Room, go.  
--Dedicated to contemporary art and innovative media, this museum features a constantly changing array of exhibits so you will always find something new. Enjoy the gorgeous views from the roof.
--If you are ever invited to a party there, especially in the Sky Room, go.
--NY (See) Check out this museum to discover kooky new artists and inspiration, then go to the roof to take in the awesome LES view!  
--The New Museum celebrates art rather than just presenting it; it renders adults something akin to playful children looking at the world through new eyes. The leading authority on contemporary art.
--on the north side, in between the 4th and 5th floors (?), a secret staircase with two notches: one: a window that sometimes shows projections on the building opposite; the other: secret rendevous spot
--Ellen Gallagher&#39;s &quot;Don&#39;t Axe Me&quot;: &quot;A 2010 video and slide installation about a shipwreck, housed in a fussily designed black box, is little more than atmospheric.&quot; (Through Sept. 15)  
--The building makes a visit here worth it, even if you don’t dig the art. Also, the New Museum attracts a very radical crowd--a great way to connect with the surrounding Lower East Side community.  
--make sure we can get to the rooftop. only open on weekends and for private events though.
--Stunning view from Sky Room - Roof Top  
--Breakfast up with maple-bacon biscuits from the first-floor cafe and search for hidden carvings of the museum in the surrounding scrap-wood stools.

--Go to New Museum and check out their Sky Room. Great view of the LES!
--get something &quot;hell yeah&quot;
--To coincide with the opening of its Chris Burden exhibition earlier this month, New York&#39;s New Museum unveiled a new eatery, Hester Street Cafe, operated by its neighbour, Hester Street Fair.  
--Go up to the education centre on the 5th floor late evening and enjoy the peace and beautiful light - like all the early SoHo artists in their loft studios along Bowery.
--The Shaft Space was created from leftover space between the third and fourth floors, after the architects realized they could carve out more gallery space by moving building ducts.  
--Don&#39;t forget to leave time to go up to the roof for some great views! Free Thursdays from 7 – 9 p.m. Discover other museum deals on MetroFocus.  
--This is a place of extremes. The Sky Room rocks, but the galleries feel like high-end interrogation cells. The art can be really good or bad. The vibe, serene or scene-y. All depends on the show.
--bring your camera and a friend to take your picture on the roof top deck!
--Interesting art work...and if you&#39;re as lucky as I was maybe you&#39;ll bump into Bono taking a private tour with his family.

--Try to go at a time when the rooftop 7th floor deck is open.  The view.  It is AMAZING.

--Frank Lloyd Wright&#39;s postwar jewel was protested by many artists when he debuted, but it has become a modern landmark for the city.  
--Most people walk the main spiral, but the smaller staircases usually house exhibits by more emerging artists.
--A fantastic art museum with many famous works situated on a unique spiral walkway.  When you walk into the main area, look up!  It makes for a great photo.
--Frank Lloyd Wright originally intended for Guggenheim visitors to take the elevator up and stroll down the ramps. Today, exhibitions are viewed both ways. The choice is yours!
--World famous for a reason! Gotta go up the spiral walkway. Don&#39;t try and skateboard down it though...
--Everything is interesting here. The building is a great piece of architecture and the exhibitions are usually must-see.
--Check out &quot;Kandinsky at the Bauhaus, 1922–1933&quot; from the permanent collection.  
--Hidden behind the wall at the first bay near the rotunda is a ceramic tile mural done by Joan Miró. The work was commissioned by museum trustee Harry F. Guggenheim in 1963 to honor his late wife.

--Seating up to 60 diners, the space comes complete with a quaint, continental-inspired bar, serving up simpler grub to hungry gallery goers.  
--Dictators believe they know how art should be made and why. Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin differed in many ways but shared that delusion, with similar results. Chaos &amp; Classicism, to Jan. 9. Read more:  
--The complexity and controversy surrounding the design of the museum lasted so long that both patron Solomon Guggenheim and architect Frank Lloyd Wright died before the building’s completion in 1959.
--The Hugo Boss Prize winner earns a solo show at this Frank Lloyd Wright–designed icon. When the building was proposed, artists from Guston to Kline wrote in protest of its unusual shape.

--Take the elevator to the top and work your way down. Walking down the spiral is much easier. Added bonus: you get to see all the art walking downstairs when leaving if it&#39;s closing time.

--Designed by Marcel Breuer, the Whitney Museum&#39;s current building opened in 1966. Jacqueline Kennedy attended the building on opening day.
